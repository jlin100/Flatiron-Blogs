## A Quick intro to my Webapp
Hello Everyone! Welcome to my phase 1 project :) 

I honestly can’t believe how far I have come and finally made it to the end of phase 1.

For this project, I will be combining my love for two things, Pokemon and JavaScript. I have built a Pokemon Team Builder App  that displays a pokedex for the original 151 pokemon using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The users are capable of viewing each pokemon’s information and adding the pokemon they want to their team. 

### My Thought Process
I started this project with the basic concept of -  I have a list of pokemon, and I want to display each of them in an individual card. So right away, I knew I needed to create a container that would be able to hold a list of information from the data I will be fetching from the API.

## Dream Team!
There is nothing more fun than getting to build an application about Pokemon. It is pretty satisfying to see the final product and get to build a team of your own. 

Here is mine Gen 1 team:
